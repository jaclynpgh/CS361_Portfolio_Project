# Portfolio Project for CS361 Software Engineering 

#### 1. Created a Travel Application that employs a teammate's mapping microservice as well as the Yelp API to obtain data.
#### 2. Created two Image scrapper microservices to be utilized by teammate's applications:
   - bingimagescrapper.py Scrapes Bing images by passing in a search query. Returns the first 35 images corresponding to the query.
   - imagescrapper.py Scrapes any website by passing in the website's url. Returns all images on the website.

#### My Travel Application was created using Python and Tkinter.
#### My Image Scraper API was created in Python with Beautiful Soup and Flask. It uses Heroku as it's server. 
##### Access it at https://jaclynsimagescraper.herokuapp.com/
